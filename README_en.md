## How to Use

1. **Create Books**

```cpp
Book book1("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling", "12345");
Book book2("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", "67890");
```

2. **Create a Library and Add Books**

```cpp
Library library;
library.addBook(book1);
library.addBook(book2);
```

3. **Display All Books in the Library**

```cpp
std::cout << "Current books in the library:" << std::endl;
displayAllBooks(library);
```

4. **Save Library Data to a `.csv` File**

```cpp
library.saveToCSV("path_to_save.csv");
```

5. **Load Library Data from a `.csv` File**

```cpp
Library newLibrary;
newLibrary.loadFromCSV("path_to_csv_file.csv");
```

6. **Search for a Book by ISBN Number**

```cpp
Book* foundBook = newLibrary.findBook("12345");
if (foundBook) {
    foundBook->display();
}
```

The above code snippets can be found in `main.cpp` and provide a basic example of how to use this project.

## Note
